Welcome to Decrypt! A game that teaches you the basics surrounding encryption. You're tasked with unscrambleing messages the game gives you. You have three chances to do so, if not you lose. If you can get past 20 days, you win! As you progress, the difficulty of the message increases.

RULES::
- You're to unscramble the message given
- The key given, are clues to how to unscramble the message
- If you unscramble the message incorrectly, then you will have to try again and 
  you lose a life
- If successful, you will move on to the next level

What is Encryption::

     The game is not an exact replication of hacking nor decryption. Its simply a way of looking
     at encryption. At the most basic, encryption is taking raw information and scrambling it to 
     the point where the message is unintelligable. Encryption is important to wireless communications
     where sensitive data needs to be protected.

     Most encryption processes, break down into a key system. Symmetric keys and asymmetric keys. 
     Symmetric keys are used for the encrypting and decrypting of information. While asymmetric keys 
     have different keys for encrypting and decrypting. This game will teach you about the different
     types of encryption algorithums.

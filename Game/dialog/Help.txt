Welcome to Decrypt! A game that teaches you the basics surrounding encryption. You're a poor hacker who is tasked with completing client's jobs, to steal information and get out of collage debt. (You were to lazy to listen to your parents)

RULES::
- First you'll be given a message for the task you'll be completing
- Once the task is accepted, a timer will begin as you attempt to complete it
- You're to unscramble the message given
- The key given, are clues to how to unscramble the message
- If you unscramble the message incorrectly, then you will have to try again and get a 
  major time reduction
- If successful, you will move on to the next level

What is Encryption::

     The game is not an exact replication of hacking nor decryption. Its simply a way of looking
     at encryption. At the most basic, encryption is taking raw information and scrambling it to 
     the point where the message is unintelligable. Encryption is important to wireless communications
     where sensitive data needs to be protected.

     Most encryption processes, break down into a key system. Symmetric keys and asymmetric keys. 
     Symmetric keys are used for the encrypting and decrypting of information. While asymmetric keys 
     have different keys for encrypting and decrypting. This game will teach you about the different
     types of encryption algorithums.
